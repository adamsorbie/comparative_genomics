WARNING: RAxML is not checking sequences for duplicate seqs and sites with missing data!



Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"

Alignment has 532 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 2.18%

RAxML experimental very fast tree search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
